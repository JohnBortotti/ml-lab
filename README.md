### [bigram model](./bigram_model/bigram_model.ipynb)

A bigram language model. This implementation shows how to create a simple character-level language model that can generate new words similar to examples it has seen.

### [micrograd](./micrograd/micrograd.ipynb)

An implementation of a small autograd engine, inspired by Andrej Karpathy's micrograd.
This notebook demonstrates building neural networks from scratch with automatic differentiation.

### [neural_probabilistic_language_model](./neural_probabilistic_language_model/neural_probabilistic_language_model.ipynb)

Implementation of the Neural Probabilistic Language Model as introduced by Bengio et al. This notebook explores the foundations of neural language modeling.
