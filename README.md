## Contents

### [bigram model](./bigram_model/bigram_model.ipynb)

A bigram language model. This implementation shows how to create a simple character-level language model that can generate new words similar to examples it has seen.

### [micrograd](./micrograd/micrograd.ipynb)

An implementation of a small autograd engine, inspired by Andrej Karpathy's micrograd.
This notebook demonstrates building neural networks from scratch with automatic differentiation.

### [neural_probabilistic_language_model](./neural_probabilistic_language_model/neural_probabilistic_language_model.ipynb)

Implementation of the Neural Probabilistic Language Model as introduced by Bengio et al. This notebook explores the foundations of neural language modeling.

### [batch_norm](./batch_norm/batch_norm.ipynb)

Experiments with Batch Normalization in neural networks.
This notebook explores how batch normalization affects training dynamics, convergence speed, and overall performance by comparing models with and without this technique.

### [optimizers](./optimizers/optimizers.ipynb)
Visualization and analysis of optimization algorithms including SGD, Momentum, and Adam.
